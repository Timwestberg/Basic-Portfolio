        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is  Tim Westberg, I am a in-training full stack developer, my primary work skills 
        up to this point are in the field of bookkeeping, sales, and business administration. 
        Although my options for my current field are vast I do not have the passion to pursue 
        a career within it. I have been interested in coding since I was 15, I dabbled in game
        code, mainly picking apart files and seeing what changed within the application. This 
        curiosity grew over the years as I had the opportunity to gain more exposure to web 
        development until I was finally able to get into the UCSD coding camp which I am now 
        attending. My goal going forward is to build effective, solid web applications that 
        effectively manage and operate the vast amount of data small business receive every day.
